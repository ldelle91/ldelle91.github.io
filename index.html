            <p>My name is Elizabeth "Liz" Delle. I'm currently in school for Computer Networking
                while holding down a full-time job at City of Kenner as a Computer Support Technician in the IT department.
                While most who go through school for a computer science degree would despise working 
                the front lines at an IT help desk, I embrace being able to do my dreamn job first.
                When not having a blast manning the front lines, I am enjoying being a core part of Pandorium
                Belly Dance Company as a primary dancer.
